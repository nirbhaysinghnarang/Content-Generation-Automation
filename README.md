#About the Project

This project is intended to generate short content (videos) via chatgpt prompting and using python. These short media contents can be shared to mass audicienes via instagram or whatsapp and it is intended to educate people about various topics like Hinduism and Indian culture, etc.

The end goal of this project is to make the content generation process and simple and quick as possible. It should eventually look like this:

1. User enters a story or topic on which they want the content to be generated about.
2. Via prompt engineering, the application generates images and text around the topic.
3. The application than fetches these and then converts them into short videos.
4. User can download these and share it to their peers or communities!
